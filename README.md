# XNAT Container Service [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/NrgXnat/container-service.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/NrgXnat/container-service)

[XNAT](http://www.xnat.org/) plugin for controlling containers (primarily [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers).

To use it, you will need an XNAT running 1.7.5+. Get the `containers-<version>-fat` jar (through one of the methods below) and put it into your `{xnat.home}/plugins` directory. Restart tomcat and you are ready to run containers. See the [guide to getting started](https://wiki.xnat.org/display/CS/Getting+Started).

This document is cross-posted on the [XNAT wiki](https://wiki.xnat.org/display/CS/Introduction) and the README in the [source repository](https://github.com/NrgXnat/container-service).

## Getting the jar
### Download
Releases are posted to the repository's [Releases tab](https://github.com/NrgXnat/container-service/releases) on GitHub. Download the version you want (probably the latest release) and [deploy it to XNAT](#deploy-to-XNAT).

### Build the jar
If you clone the source repository, you can build an XNAT plugin jar by running

```
[container-service] $ ./gradlew fatJar
```

The jar will be created as `build/libs/containers-${VERSION}-fat.jar`

## Deploy to XNAT
One you [have a jar](#getting-the-jar), copy it to the `${xnat.home}/plugins` directory, and restart tomcat.

Where is `${xnat.home}`? If you are using a VM generated by the [XNAT Vagrant project](https://bitbucket.org/xnatdev/xnat_vagrant), `xnat.home` is in the `~/${PROJECT}` directory (and the default value for `${PROJECT}` is `xnat`). If you aren't using the Vagrant project, or even if you are and you're still confused, then `${xnat.home}/logs` is where XNAT writes its logs; you'll want the `plugins` directory which should be right next to the `logs` directory.
