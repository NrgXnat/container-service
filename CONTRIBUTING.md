# Contributing to the XNAT Container Service

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

We welcome any [bug reports](#report-an-issue), feature requests, or [questions](#ask-a-question). And we super-duper welcome any [pull requests](#make-a-pull-request).

This document is a little sparse now, but will hopefully evolve in the future.

## Report an issue

If you have (or want to open) an account on the [XNAT JIRA](https://issues.xnat.org), you could make an issue there; just add it to the [Container Service project](https://issues.xnat.org/projects/CS).
Alternatively, [ask a question on the discussion group](#ask-a-question)

## Ask a question

First, check the [XNAT Discussion Board](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/xnat_discussion). It is possible that someone has already asked your question and gotten an answer, so it could save you a lot of time to search around first. And if no one has asked your question, the discussion board is a great first place to ask.


## Run the Tests
The various unit tests can be run with:
```
[container-service]$ ./gradlew unitTest
```

If you have a docker server that you can use for testing, there are some additional tests that can run. Make sure your docker environment is all set up (you can test this by making sure `$ docker version` works). Then run all the tests with
```
[container-service]$ ./gradlew test
```
In order to synchronize your Docker VM clock, you may need to initially run the command as:
```
[container-service]$ docker run --rm --privileged alpine:latest hwclock -s && ./gradlew  clean test
```
We do not have any tests that can integrate with a running XNAT. All of the tests in this library use bespoke databases and mocked interfaces any time the code intends to communicate with XNAT. We welcome your contributions!

## Make a Pull Request
If you want to contribute code, we will be very happy to have it.

The first thing you should know is that we do almost all of our work on the `dev` branch, or on smaller "feature" branches that come from and merge into `dev`. So if you want to do something with the code, you, too, should start a new branch from `dev` on our [BitBucket repo](https://bitbucket.org/xnatdev/container-service).




And thanks again!
