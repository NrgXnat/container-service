And they are made to be run either on a single subject or across a group of them with the change of a single flag, but we can't launch in the latter way ([N->1](https://wiki.xnat.org/display/CS/Bulk+Launching+Containers)). | <ac:structured-macro ac:name="status"><ac:parameter ac:name="colour">Blue</ac:parameter><ac:parameter ac:name="title">Open</ac:parameter></ac:structured-macro>                 | [CS-237](https://issues.xnat.org/browse/CS-237) |

# A Note on NIL Tools
Many of the existing tools employed in the NRG lab—often as pipelines on CNDA or TIP—rely on tools written by the NeuroImaging Lab (NIL). These tools are not easily containerizable for two reasons:

1. The source code is not publicly available. This impedes publishing derivative works in several ways.
    * Dockerfiles should not reference this code. The purpose of a Dockerfile is to facilitate reproducible builds of Docker images on different machines or by different people. If the NIL tools are included, then the build may only take place on those few machines that have access to the source code.
    * The code should not be contained within a Docker image not controlled by NIL. This image would become the _de facto_ official release of the tools. If such an image were to exist, it should by all rights belong to the owner and creator of those tools: the NIL.
2. The tools often rely on the local availablity of atlas image files. Those altas images are available on the internal servers we have here, but are not generally available. If the atlases were included in a Docker image, its size would be many tens of gigabytes (typical sizes are tens to hundreds of megabytes). This would be prohibitive to install or develop against.

For this reason, any tool that is written using the NIL tools is not, in general, possible to containerize at this time. Exceptions are certainly possible; for instance, the lesion atlas image used only a few NIL tools, which could be copied directly into the Docker image itself. However, while this image can be created, is not distributable for reason 1. above.
